# cmip6-climate-scenarios-SAWS-DFFE
This repository provides tools and scripts to calculate climate indices using CMIP6 climate projections. It utilises data from NASAâ€™s Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) to analyse climate extremes across South Africa. The analysis encompasses multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) climate change scenarios spanning various future timeframes for South Africa. It also integrates information from bio-climatic regions and urban centres to support regional climate impact assessments.
